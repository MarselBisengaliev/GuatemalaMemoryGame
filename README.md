## About this project:
<p>Thanks to this project, I learned how to work with a variable like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let">let</>. I changed them every time I needed to work with new data, leaving the old variable.</p>

<p>I also learned how to create a SetTimeout function. It is used to constantly call another function. In this project it was necessary: to make sure that the time was correctly updated.</p>
